2. Factory Pattern:    Used in the creation of all models which follows the factory of all models in models folder.
                       
3. DRY principle:      it follows the DRY principle.

4. Facade Pattern:     It hides the complexity and provide the contrllers which is useful for working with endpoint etc.

5. Always follows close to modification principle. as repository extends the base class instead of modifying it.
6. Function is responsible for their unit of work and independent from other functions.
7. Also separated the changing part from the static part.
8. Decorator Patterns: Also using decorator pattern to increase the functionality of the function as @reporitory, @inject etc decorator.
